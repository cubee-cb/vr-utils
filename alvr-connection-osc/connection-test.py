ALVRConnectionOSC

Small program to send an OSC message with a BOOL value when a headset connects or disconnects to ALVR, describing its current connection status.

Setup:
- Place the script files somewhere ALVR can get to.
- Open ALVR's config screen. (or session.json if you're feeling special)
- Change the "On Connect Script" and "On Disconnect Script" options to contain the *absolute* path to the script.bat file.
  - Linux users: make a .sh file that runs connection.py and use that. I trust you know at least how to do that. I have no Linux VR setup at the moment so I can't test.
